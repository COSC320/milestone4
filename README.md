Input files (dataset) are from the provided csv files on canvas, add the name of file "file.csv" for example when running with both algorithms. 
Our abbreviations.txt contains the abbreviations with their meanings

for convenience both folders contain the same abbreviations.txt

**NOTE :
IF YOU USE GIT CLONE ON THE REPO ENSURE YOU USE ABSOLUTE PATHING FOR THE .CSV and .TXT. THESE VALUES HAVE BEEN LEFT BLANK IN THE .JAVA AS THEY ARE IN ACCORDANCE TO THE INDIVIDUAL RUNNING THE PROGRAMS**


If you git clone and open up the project entirely you need to use absolute pathing for the abbreviations.txt and file.csv, if you open up the folder itself you can use relative pathing i.e., if you open up first_algo only you can use relative pathing for the file.csv and abbreviations.txt

# first_algo
- contains two .java files , first_implementation.java will output a csv file with the replaced meanings of the abbreviations, first_implementation_graph.java will output a csv file with the value the string length, word count and execution time of each string. These values were used to calculate and graph the time complexity. 

# second_algo
- contains three .java files, debrev.java is what you want to run, uses the trie.java class and will output a csv file with the replaced abbreviations. trie_graph.java will output a csv files with the string length, word count ane execution time of each string. These values were used to calculate and graph the time complexity.
